# Summary
Holographic beam shaping using spatial light modulators (SLMs) as a reprogrammable hologram offers a powerful tool for precise and flexible optical controls. It has been adopted for a wide range of research, including atom trapping[@gaunt2012robust], optical addressing of individual quantum objects[@motlakunta2023preserving;@islam2015measuring], and multi-beam laser machining[@obata2010multi].

`pySLM2` is a python package designed for full-stack control of SLMs for holographic beam shaping, encompassing hologram generation, simulation, and hardware controls.

The package implements the hologram generation algorithms of the Lee hologram[@lee1978iii] and its improved predecessors from @zupancic2016ultra and @shih2021reprogrammable, targeting the digital micromirror device (DMD) based SLM with binary amplitude controls. It also implements the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm[@gerhberg1972practical] suitable for liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) based SLMs with pure phase controls.

Under the hood, the package uses `TensorFlow` for intensive numerical computations. By leveraging `TensorFlow`, the package harnesses the power of GPUs for faster computation without the need for code modification. This results in a significant speed-up for algorithms that require robust numerical computation, such as many hologram generation algorithms relying on iterative Fourier transformations.

Additionally, the package offers a universal interface for different SLMs, ensuring that code written for one device can be seamlessly adapted to another. As of this writing, the package supports DMDs from both Visitech and Vialux.

# Statement of need
High-quality optical controls are crucial for numerous scientific and engineering applications. For instance, in atom-based quantum information processors, individual atom quantum states are often manipulated by individually addressable laser beams. The quality of these addressing beams directly impacts the fidelity of quantum operations[@motlakunta2023preserving].

Holographic beam shaping using SLMs provides a potent tool for precise and adaptive optical controls. Compared to conventional optical elements, holographic beam shaping has several advantages. Firstly, it can generate arbitrary beam profiles that are challenging to create with standard optical elements. For example, the Laguerre-Gaussian beam with a non-zero azimuthal index (often referred to as a doughnut beam), which can be used to trap atoms in a tube-like potential[@kuga1997novel], apply angular momentum to Bose-Einstein Condensation[@andersen2006quantized], or achieve super-resolution imaging[@qian2021super;@drechsler2021optical].

Secondly, holographic beam shaping can actively correct optical aberrations in the system, achieving diffraction-limited performance. This enables the faithful production of target beam profiles with high accuracy. It has been shown that residual aberrations can be corrected to less than $\lambda/20$ root-mean-square (RMS)[@shih2021reprogrammable;@zupancic2016ultra], which is smaller than most of the manufacturing tolerances of optical elements.

At the time of writing, the `pySLM2` package, as detailed in this manuscript, has been employed in the research of @shih2021reprogrammable, @motlakunta2023preserving, and @kotibhaskar2023programmable. The authors believe that the package will benefit a broader community of researchers and engineers by offering turnkey solutions for applying holographic beam shaping to their work. Moreover, the primitives included in the package can assist researchers in rapidly prototyping new hologram generation algorithms.


# Fourier Holography Basics

`pySLM2` is designed for holographic beam shaping using Fourier holography. The name "Fourier" comes from the fact that the hologram and the target beam profile are related by a Fourier transformation.

 In a paraxial lens system, the lens act as a Fourier transform operator mapping the electric field in one focal plane to the electric field in the another focal plane. In the context of Fourier Holography, the two focal plane are referred as the image plane (IP) and the Fourier plane (FP). The electric field at the two planes, $E_{\mathrm{IP}}(\mathbf{x}')$ and $E_{\mathrm{FP}}(\mathbf{x})$ respectively, are related by the following equation:

$$
E_{\mathrm{FP}}(\mathbf{x})\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i} \Phi_{ab}} = \left. \frac{\lambda f}{2 \pi}  \mathcal{F}\left [E_{\mathrm{IP}} (\mathbf{x}')\right ](\mathbf{k}') \right | _{\mathbf{k}'=\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda f} \mathbf{x}}
$$
In which, $\mathbf{x}'$ and $\mathbf{k}'$ denote the spatial coordinate and the wave vector at the image plane respectively, and $\mathcal{F}$ denotes Fourier transformation. 
The wave vector $\mathbf{k}'$ is related to the spatial coordinate $\mathbf{x}$ at FP by $\mathbf{x} = \frac{\lambda f}{2 \pi}\mathbf{k}'$. 

The aberrations of the optical system can be modeled as a phase map $\Phi_{\mathrm{ab}}$ in the Fourier plane. In `pySLM2`'s convention, the plane SLM is placed is Fourier plane, and the image plane is where the targeted beam profile is desired. The SLM modulates the beam at Fourier plane to engineer the desired beam profiles at the image plane.

# Usages
`pySLM2` offers a range of commonly used optics profiles right out of the box, including Hermite Gaussian, Laguerre Gaussian, super Gaussian (also known as "flat top"), and Zernike polynomials. These profiles are implemented as functional objects, and `pySLM2` automatically handles the profile sampling during hologram calculations.

For profiles that are not included by default, users have the option to either inherit from the base class and implement their custom profiles or generate the sampled profiles in an array format to pass them to the hologram calculation function. As illustrated in Fig. \autoref{fig:lg}, here's an example of creating a hologram to generate a Laguerre Gaussian beam with a mode of $l=1$, $p=0$, which often referred to as a "doughnut beam", from the fundamental Gaussian mode. Unless specified, the simulation shown in this paper is simulated with the following conditions: $\lambda=369~\mathrm{nm}$ wavelength, $f=200~\mathrm{mm}$ Fourier lens focal length, and with Texas Instrument DLP9500 as the SLM ($1~\mathrm{px} = 10~\mu \mathrm{m}$ micromirror size).

The arithmetic operations of the profiles are also overloaded, so one can easily combine different profiles through addition or rescale the profiles through multiplication. Shown in Fig. \autoref{fig:multi}, we create a hologram to generate two Gaussian beams. In the source code, it is written as adding two Gaussian profiles together at different positions.

## Aberration Correction
One of the key advantages of holographic beam shaping is its capability to correct optical aberrations, and `pySLM2` provides an easy and efficient method to achieve this correction. By supplying the aberration information during the hologram calculation, `pySLM2` generates a hologram imprinted with a phase profile opposite to the aberration, effectively canceling it out.

In the example depicted in \autoref{fig:aberration}, we simulate the beam profile at the image plane both with and without aberration correction. Without aberration correction, the beam profile becomes distorted and broadened. In this particular simulation, spherical aberration is used, but `pySLM2` is capable of correcting other types of aberrations as well.


![Simulation of the beam profiles at the image plane with and without aberration correction. The source code of this example can be found in `examples/aberration_correction.py`. \label{fig:aberration}](aberration_correction.png)

To obtain the phase map of the aberration, one can either use a wavefront sensor, such as a Shackâ€“Hartmann sensor[@shack1971production], to measure the wavefront, or one can allow light from different parts of the Fourier plane to interfere with each other to reconstruct the aberration phase profile from the resulting interference patterns. For a detailed description of the latter method, one can refer to @shih2021reprogrammable.

## Hardware Controls
`pySLM2` provides hardware controls for DMDs from both Visitech and Vialux. The controllers from these two companies use different communication protocols and architectures. The Visitech controller uses UDP over Ethernet, while the Vialux controller uses USB3.

One of the goals of `pySLM2` is to abstract the hardware details and offer a unified application interface for interacting with these devices. For instance, we've implemented the same `load_single` and `load_multiple` functions within the controller classes for both manufacturers' devices. These functions allow for the display of single holograms or the loading of multiple holograms that can be switched by triggers.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.
